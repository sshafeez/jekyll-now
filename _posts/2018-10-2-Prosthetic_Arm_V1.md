Prosthetics are not cheap devices, and they are especially costly for children. As the child grows, the old prosthetics stops fitting properly and they must order a new custom-formed prosthetic. 3D printing creates a fantastic,cheaper alternative.

It was a great experience working with Michigan Nueroprosthetics to develop a 3D-printed myo-Electric Proshetic arm for a below elbow patient, Julian. I lead the electrical subteam which assembles all the electronics in the arm and writes the corresponding software.

You can check out a clip of Julian trying out his new arm for the first time.

The total cost of the arm is only $100 dollars and we strive to make the arm even better for its price point.
We also look to experiment with several other technologies in our V2 release. You can check out our feature of our first arm

The controls use a peak detection system of signals from the bicep to determine when to actuate the arm. The circuit also goes into sleep mode when not in use to extend battery life to 6-8 hrs(with moderate usage).

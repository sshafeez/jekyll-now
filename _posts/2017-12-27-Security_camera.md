title: Low Power Security Camera
---
I have several IP cameras in my home, but they aren't usually as useful for home security as the may initially seem. Sure you can record and stream video to make sure your home is safe, but it isn't reasonable to have it stream video anytime you leave the house.

 The simple solution was to integrate a cheap usb camera with a PIR sensor to allow it to respond only to changes in the environment. The colorful LEDs were added just to make it work in dark lighting and to add some unique flare.

The casing is quite neat and compact despite two boards in use. In hindsight, two power supplies was a tad much, and I would have probably been fine with just the 40W supply and a regulator or two.
